In this Project Challenge I have used react version 17.0.02. I have used Redux in order to  manage the state management .
In order to start this project . Firstly download or install the git clone or zip from git hub and then in order to install all the dependencies  run the commnand "npm install" it will automatically install all the dependecies related  to the project and then for starting the react app run the commnand "npm start"in order to run the react app locally on the system.


I have used Functional based components rather than using class based components. used Tailwind Css as an cdn link for doing quick front end design .

I mainly done  more focus on Functionality rather than making the front end design more attractive.

Both the challenges are quite good in term of using my knowledge .
